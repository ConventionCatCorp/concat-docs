# About Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to set up external applications to receive notifications when certain events happen. When a webhook event is triggered, we'll send a HTTP POST payload to the provided URL for the application.

These webhook events can be used to trigger automated actions in third-party applications, such as updating access control, mailing lists, and more.

## Test event

When you setup a webhook, you can send a test event to verify that the webhook is working correctly by using the **Test** button in Housekeeping.
