# Banning an Attendee

Banning an attendee means that they will no longer be able to register for the convention in the future, and will be completely locked out of their existing account. This is also referred to as a **Registration Ban** in ConCat, as they cannot register for the event or register for a new account.

Banning an attendee does not *require* an account however. Bans are based on the attendee's first and last name.

  1. (if it is not already) Set the "Ban Category" to **Registration**.
5. If the attendee you are banning already has a ConCat account, search for and select the user underneath "User (optional)".
  1. Otherwise, enter their first and last name in the respective fields below the "Ban Category" dropdown.
6. Enter details about the ban in the "Text" box.
7. Select "Create".
