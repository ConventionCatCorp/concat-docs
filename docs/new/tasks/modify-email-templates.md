# Modifying an Email Template
Customers can modify the default email templates that ConCat refers to for automatic emailing. Through Handlebars, we provide a form of [Mail merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_merge).

**NOTE:** Handlebars is only available in email templates, not within the Mass Email feature.

## What is Handlebars?
[Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) is a templating system that allows for data to be dynamically filled in on a per-user basis. Handlebars has lots of use cases, but ConCat primarily utilizes it for our emails.
