# Create a Product

Registration products need to be created inside of the registration product category.

When the user finishes buying the registration, they are given a “product grant”, in which it allows them to check in at the convention.

## Create your first React Page

Open registration under "Settings".

## Transfer registration

Users with paid registrations can transfer their digital grant to other users. Click the "..." button in the "Register" page.

## Refund requests

Users can request for a refund, have it reviewed by administrators, and if approved, have Stripe refund the money, and have the digital grant removed.
