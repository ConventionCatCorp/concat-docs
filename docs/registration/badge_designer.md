# Badge Designer

The badge designer allows for the choosing of a print size, and a photoshop-layer style positioning of elements.

By specifying the layer position, size, font, text resizing policy, and content. The content can be a variety of user-specified content, such as badge name, species, registration level, user id, and others.

The system should be compatible with any printer.
