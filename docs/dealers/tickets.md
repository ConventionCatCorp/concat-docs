# Tickets

Attendees can enter specific time slots of when they are allowed to enter the dealer’s location, and acquire QR codes from ConCat before the convention.

The QR codes can then be scanned by volunteers, and allow the attendee to enter the dealer’s den at the specified time slot, or later.
