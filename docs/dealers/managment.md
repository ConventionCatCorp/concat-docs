# Dealers

Attendees can apply to be dealers, by specifying information about their business, what products they intend to sell, and what amenities they need during the convention.

Amenities are products that need to be created within the dealer product category. Such amenities are usually products such as the table size, the need for electricity, or the need to be in an 18+ section.

Dealer applications then need to be approved by a vendor administrator, at which point the vendor will be sent an email, and the products will be added to their cart.

After the vendor pays for their amenities, the vendor will be promoted to an “approved (paid)” status.

## Dealer assistants 

Dealers are allowed to request for assistants, which when approved, will be also given a “Dealer” status on their badge.
