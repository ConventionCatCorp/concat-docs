# Dealers

Attendees can apply to be dealers, by specifying information about their business, what products they intend to sell, and what amenities they need during the convention.

Amenities are products that need to be created within the dealer product category. Such amenities are usually products such as the table size, the need for electricity, or the need to be in an 18+ section.

Dealer applications then need to be approved by a vendor administrator, at which point the vendor will be sent an email, and the products will be added to their cart.

After the vendor pays for their amenities, the vendor will be promoted to an Approved (Paid)” status.

:::info Note
Dealers are still expected to pay for their registration. If you'd like to offer a discount or registration for free, you can do so via a [Product Discount](/docs/guides/products/discounts)

# Dealer Areas

Dealers may apply to more than one dealer area (if only one exists then they will not be given the option). Each dealer area have a different product category, which gives the dealer different choices of table types to pick from. This category **must** be created before creating the dealer area.

# Creating a Vendor Category 

You can manage Vendor Categories directly from the Dealers tab.

Head to the "Products" tab, you'll see any existing Vendor Categories. Create one with the "Create Category" button at the top.

Visible products will be displayed as table types that the dealer can choose.

Hidden products that are set as "Addons" to the visible products will be displayed as additional optional choices for dealers to pick.

# Item Categories 

This list is for information only. Edit the list of product choices a dealer has under the "System" > "Settings" > "Vendor" list.
<!-- todo: clarify what this means -->

## Dealer Assistants 

Dealers are allowed to request for assistants, which when approved, will be also given a “Dealer” status on their badge. 

Once they have been approved and pay for their table, Dealers can head to the "Vendor" tab (where they applied) and select the "Manage Assistants" button in order to add and manage their assistants. They will need to know the assistant's username.
