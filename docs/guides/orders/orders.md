# Orders

An order is a collection of products (such as an event registration, vendor table, or event store purchase) a given attendee wants to purchase. Order are created automatically when an attendee has a product added to their cart.

Orders can be viewed through the "**Orders**" page in Housekeeping, or through the orders tab on an attendee's profile.

### Order states

Orders can be in one of two states: **unpaid** and **paid**. Orders will transition from the unpaid to paid state whenever payment is made in full, a voucher meets or exceeds the order total, or the order is manually marked as paid via the "**Orders**" page.

Unpaid orders currently do not expire, but can be edited and cancelled at any time through the housekeeping interface.

### Creating an order

Most of the time, an order is created automatically when an attendee adds a product to their cart. However, if you need to manually add a product to an attendee's cart, but they don't have an existing unpaid order, you can create one using the following steps:

<ol className="numbered-list">
  <li>
    <span>
      Navigate to your event website, then click "<strong>Housekeeping</strong>" from the left-hand sidebar.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Click "<strong>User Search</strong>" from the left-hand sidebar, then click the "<strong>Orders</strong>" tab.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Click "<strong>Create New Order</strong>".
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Click "<strong>Show Details</strong>" on the newly created order to open it in the "<strong>Orders</strong>" page. Click the plus (<i className="material-symbols-outlined">add</i>) icon next to "<strong>Pending Payment</strong>" to add a product to the order.
    </span>
  </li>
</ol>

### Modifying an order

While an order is **unpaid**, you can add, modify, or remove products and vouchers on the order. You can also mark the order as paid, or cancel the order.

:::note Limitations
It is not currently possible to:
* Override the line item price of a product
* Change the reference ID for an attendance type product
* Add an existing voucher to an order
* Request shipping details that differ from the attendee's address
