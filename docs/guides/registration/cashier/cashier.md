# Cashier UI

Cashier Mode is a special interface designed to optimize the workflow of checking users into the convention and giving out badges.

Cashiers can use a handheld barcode scanner (PDF417) to scan driver’s licenses for faster check-ins.

The interface is specifically tailored for faster check-ins, such as pinpointing mismatched information with the driver’s license, pointing out if the user is underage, missing payments, if they are a guardian, if there are any notes/bans on the user’s profile, if the badge contains banned words, etc...
