# Attendance Tiers

Attendance Tiers are the different levels of registration that are available for your attendees to select from when
they register. On other platforms, these are sometimes referred to as "tiers", "packages", or "ticket types".

For each tier, you can customize details like the description, price, stock levels, and more.

### Creating a Attendance Tier

You can create an unlimited number of attendance tiers, using the following steps:

<ol className="numbered-list">
  <li>
    Navigate to your event website, then click "<strong>Housekeeping</strong>" from the left-hand sidebar.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click "<strong>Products</strong>" from the left-hand sidebar, then under the Registration category click "<strong>View Products</strong>".
  </li>
  <li>
    Click "<strong>Create New Product</strong>".
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
      Enter basic information for your Attendance Type:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Name</strong> - This is the name of your Attendance Tier (like "Attendee" or "Sponsor"). If you'd like to use a different name externally, you can do so in the "Display Name" field.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Description</strong> - A brief description of what is offered by this tier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Base Price</strong> - The price that will be charged for this tier, before any add-ons or discounts are applied.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stock Control</strong> - Whether or not you want to control the number of tickets that can be purchased for this tier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pass Platform Fee to Customer</strong> - By default, our platform fees are absorbed into the cost of each product and are paid by the event, but as the organizer, you can choose to pass these fees to your attendees.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Make Product Publicly Visible</strong> - By default, your new Attendance Tier will not be shown as a selectable tier, but you can make it visible by checking this box. This can be used for special tiers you don't want available for purchase, such as "Guest of Honor" or "Talent".
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
      <i>(Optional)</i> Customize advanced options:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Available From</strong> - The date that this tier will be available for purchase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Available Until</strong> - The date that this tier will no longer be available for purchase.
        </li>

          <strong>Minimum Purchase Age</strong> - The minimum age that attendees must be to purchase this tier.
        </li>

        </li>

    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Click "<strong>Create Product</strong>", and your Attendance Tier will be created!
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
      <i>(Optional)</i> Customize your Attendance Tier:
      <div style={{ marginBottom: "1rem" }} />
      <splitColumn childStyle={{ width: "100%" }}>
        <bigButton title="Product Images" href="#">
          Adding a product image is a great way to show your attendees any swag or goodies offered with the tier.
        </bigButton>
        <bigButton title="Addons" href="#">
          Addons are other products that are offered alongside, or are included for free with, the tier.
        </bigButton>
        <bigButton title="Discounts" href="#">
          Discounted pricing can be available for a set period of time, or to a specific user role (such as Staff or Volunteers).
        </bigButton>
        <bigButton title="Upgrade Paths" href="#">
          Upgrade Paths allow you to offer attendees the ability to upgrade to a higher tier after purchase.
        </bigButton>
        <bigButton title="Product Options" href="#">
          Product Options enable you to add custom fields (required or optional) for your attendees to fill out when they purchase the tier (such as "T-Shirt Size", "Company Name", or "Extra Donation").
        </bigButton>
        <bigButton title="Surcharges" href="#">
          Surcharges are additional fees that are added to the base price of the tier as either a flat fee or a percentage of the base price.
        </bigButton>
      </splitColumn>
    </div>
