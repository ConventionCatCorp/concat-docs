# Attendance Tiers

Attendance Tiers are the different levels of registration that are available for your attendees to select from when
they register. On other platforms, these are sometimes referred to as "tiers", "packages", or "ticket types".

Within ConCat, Attendance Tiers are treated as a special type of Product and can be customized in the same way.

### Creating an Attendance Tier

To create a new Attendance Tier, follow the instructions on [Creating a Product](/docs/guides/products#creating-a-product) and select the <strong>Registration</strong> category at Step 2.

Attendance Tiers created in this way will be available for registration on the registration page if <strong>Make Product Publicly Visible</strong> is checked, otherwise it will only be visible for selection through Housekeeping.
