# Attendance Tiers

Attendance Tiers are the different levels of registration that are available for your attendees to select from when
they register. On other platforms, these are sometimes referred to as "tiers", "packages", or "ticket types".

Within ConCat, Attendance Tiers are treated as a special type of Product and can be customized in the same way.

### Creating an Attendance Tier

To create a new Attendance Tier, follow the instructions on [Creating a Product](/docs/guides/products#creating-a-product) and select the <strong>Registration</strong> category at Step 2.

Attendance Tiers created in this way will be available for registration on the registration page if <strong>Make Product Publicly Visible</strong> is checked, otherwise it will only be visible for selection through Housekeeping.

### Upgrade Paths for Attendance Tiers

Once your Attendance Tier is created, you can set up Upgrade Paths. This allows your attendees to upgrade their Attendance Tier to a higher tier seemlessly, charging users just the price difference.

### About Attendance Tier Addons

Utilizing [Product Addons](/docs/guides/products/addons) is a great way to keep track of bundled swag like T-Shirts. There are a few specific notes when using addons with Attendance Tiers:

* Any addons that are marked complimentary will be added to the attendees cart automatically upon checkout. 
* Non-complimentary addons will be displayed after the attendee finishes configuring their registration.
