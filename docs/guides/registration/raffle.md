# Raffles

For events with limited space, raffles allow to have a lottery for your attendee registration. All registrations will be given a virtual raffle ticket, in which the event organizer can choose when to run the raffle at a later date.

Each ticket has 5 different states:
* waiting - The user is waiting for the raffle to run
* winner - The raffle has run, and the user is allowed to purchase a registration
* redeemed - The user has won, and used their ticket to purchase a registration
* rescinded - The user has lost, and no longer allowed to re-enter the raffle
* deleted - The user has lost, and is allowed to re-enter the raffle for the next round

# Setting up the raffle

To create a raffle, visit the "Raffles" page under the "Product Management" page, and create a new raffle. To have a fair raffle, where every entrant has an equal change of winning, set the weight configuration to have a "Static Value: 1". 

Then configure every product for registration under the "Associated Products" in the raffle. 

# Running the raffle 

Click on "Run Raffle" under the "Entrants" section of the raffle page. Follow the instructions on the page.

# Ticket points

Tickets also hold points, that can be given to non-winners after every raffle. The points can be added to the weight configuration to give repeateded non-winners a higher chance of winning.
