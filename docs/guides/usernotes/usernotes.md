# User Notes

User Notes allows you to add additional informaton to user profiles in order to assist operations.

There are 8 types of user notes: **Commendation**, **Reprimand**, **Request**, **Restriction**, **Ban**, **Cashier**, **Feedback**, and **Misc**.

## Cashier

Cashier notes are notes that will specifically be shown when an attendee is checking in at registration. This is most useful for any special handling that may be required for specific attendees.

## Bans

Bans prevent users from performing specific actions, and will display a generic error message.

Bans can be issued with or without an account. With an account, the associated account receives the ban and will be restricted from the respective actions. Without an account, a full legal name (first and last) must be provided.

If a user banned from registration attempts to register, a review will be requested. These reviews will appear in the dashboard to be approved or denied.

## Restriction

Restriction notes will show a notice that the user has a restriction on their account on internal lists like the user search and volunteer list. These are effectively "shadow bans" as the user is never aware of or shown any information about it. 

### Reprimand, Request, Commendation, Feedback, and Misc

These notes hold no special properties and simply show up when viewing a user's notes tab. We provide multiple categories to assist with organization of general notes like these.
