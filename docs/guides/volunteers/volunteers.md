# Volunteers

Attendees have the option to fill out a volunteer application form, listing out their availability, their preferred contacts methods, and what departments they are interested in helping. 

An application can have these distinct states to a department: 
* __Interested__: User is interested in participating in this department.
* __Previous Experience__: User has previously helped in a department.
* __Avoid__: User does not want to be part of this department.
* __Requested (Internal)__: A department lead has requested this user to be assigned to their department.
* __Assigned (Internal)__: The volunteer has been assigned by an admin to the department.

## Human Resources
Adminstators with the `hr` role can manage the volunteer settings, manage departments, and assign volunteers to departments.

## Departments
Each department can be assigned leads, look at un-approved volunteer applications, and request applications to be assigned to their department. 

Departments leads must also be assigned the `user` role to have access to their housekeeping pages.

## Staff 
Adminstators can also assign volunteers as staff, (TODO: Why?), and give users a voucher. The value of the voucher can be configured on the configuration page.
