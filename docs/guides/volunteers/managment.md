# Volunteer managment

Attendees have the option to fill out a volunteer application form, listing out their availability, and what departments they are interested or not interested in. 


## Departments

Each department is assigned a lead, and then can look at un-approved volunteer applications, and request them to be assigned to their department. 

The volunteer leads can then assign volunteers to departments, and grant vouchers to help the volunteer pay for the convention registration.

## Promoting to staff

Users promoted to staff will be given a voucher. The voucher value can be configued under settings.

(TODO: What are the side-effects of the user having a staff role?)
