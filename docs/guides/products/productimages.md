# Product Images

Images are a great way to show off your products and their features. You can create a gallery of images for your product, or just upload a single image. Only the first image will be used as the main image for the product.

Uploaded images are currently limited by the following constraints:
- Images must be no larger than 1MB in size.
- Images must be in PNG format.
- Images should be at least 512x512 pixels in size, and rectangular in shape.

Product Images can be uploaded or deleted from edit page of a product. See the Modifying a Product section for instructions.

:::note Upcoming Change
Product Images are not currently shown for registration products or on the cart page. We are working on a solution for
supporting these use cases in the future.
