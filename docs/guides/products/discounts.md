# Discounts

Discounts allow you to offer early-bird or staff / volunteer discounts to your attendees on any product. Discounts can also be set to expire on a given date or run indefinitely.

### Creating a Discount

You can create an unlimited number of discounts, using the following steps:

<splitColumn>
  <ol class="numbered-list">
    <li>
      <span>
        In <strong>Housekeeping</strong>, navigate to the product page for the product you want to add a discount to.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Click the green plus (<i className="material-symbols-outlined">add</i>) button next to the "<strong>Discounts</strong>" section.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Enter the discounted price. This is the price that attendees will pay if they purchase the product, <strong>not</strong> how much the discount is.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <i>(Optional)</i> If you want to limit the discount to a single or set of roles, search for them and select them from the dropdown.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        <i>(Optional)</i> By default, discounts will become active immediately, but you can customize both the <strong>Available From</strong> and <strong>Available Until</strong> dates.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Click "<strong>Create Discount Price</strong>".
      </span>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <div>
    <img className="bordered-img" src="/img/tutorial/productDiscount.png" />
  </div>
</splitColumn>

### Deleting a Discount

You can delete a discount by clicking the red trash can (<i className="material-symbols-outlined">delete</i>) next to the discount.

:::note
Deleting a discount will cause any unpaid orders to reflect the non-discounted price, unless another matching discount exists. Paid orders will not be affected.
