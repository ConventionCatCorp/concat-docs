# Addons

Addons are a way to offer bundles of products to your attendees. A common use case is to include swag items for attendees who have purchased a higher tier of Attendance Type. Any product in the system can be added as an addon to another product.

### Creating an Addon

You can add an unlimited number of products as addons to any product, using the following steps:

<ol class="numbered-list">
  <li>
    <span>
      In <strong>Housekeeping</strong>, navigate to the product page for the product you want to add addons to.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Click the green plus (<i className="material-symbols-outlined">add</i>) button next to the "<strong>Addons</strong>" section.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Search for the product you want to add as an addon and select it from the dropdown.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>
      Check the "<strong>Addon is complimentary</strong>" checkbox, then click "<strong>Create Add-on</strong>".
    </span>
  </li>
</ol>

### Upsell Addons

Upsell addons are a way to offer additional swag, limited-seating event tickets, or other products in addition to an existing purchase. These are shown after an attendee has added a product to their cart, but before they checkout.

To add an upsell addon, follow the steps above and leave the checkbox for "<strong>Addon is complimentary</strong>" unchecked.
